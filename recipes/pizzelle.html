    <h3>What is This?</h3>
      <p>The death of a neutron star only means rebirth, the atoms displace at unfathomable speeds across the universe, never truely destroyed. Much like the base of all recipes' pizzelle, the components are merely rebuilt into something greater. How will you align the chains of carbon and hydrogen? Read on to find out.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
          <ul>

          <ol>
            <li>Gather the Ingredients</li>
            <li>Beat eggs and sugar in large bowl until thick. Stir in melted butter and vanilla. Silft together flour and baking powder, and blend into the batter until smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat the pizzelle iron, and brush with oil. Drop about one tablespoon of batter onto each circle on the iron. You may need to experiment with the amount of batter and baking time depending on the iron. Bake for 20 to 45 seconds or until steam is no longer coming out of the iron. Carefully remove cookie from the iron and repeat with remaining batter.</li>
            <li>Cool completely before storing in an airtight container.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
